Welcome to the ESL API! You can use the API to access ESL API endpoints, which can get information on cards and sets. All API access is performed over HTTPS and accessed from the `https://api.elderscrollslegends.io` domain.

To use the API endpoints, the format is as follows:

`https://api.elderscrollslegends.io/<version>/<resource>`

For example:

`https://api.elderscrollslegends.io/v1/cards`

There are multiple SDKs available to make it even easier to consume the API.
